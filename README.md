# Daily DSA Challenges

Welcome to my repository dedicated to daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges! This project is designed to help me practice and improve my coding skills by solving one problem each day.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- To strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.
- To document my solutions and thought processes.
- To build a portfolio of coding challenges.

## ðŸ“š Languages and Technologies

- **Java**: Main programming language for challenges.

## ðŸ¥‡ Challenge Log

### Day 1: [Third Maximum Number](Day1-ThirdMax.java)
- **Description**: Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
  
### Day 2: [Search Insert Position](./Day2-SearchInsert.java)
- **Description**: Search for a target value in a sorted array or determine the position where it should be inserted.

### Day 3: [Remove Element](./Day3-RemoveElement.java)
- **Description**: Remove all instances of a specific value from an array.

### Day 4: [Max Consecutive Ones](./Day4-MaxConsecutiveOnes.java)
- **Description**: Find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

### Day 5: [Length of Last Word](./Day5-LengthOfLastWord.java)
- **Description**: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

### Day 6: [FizzBuzz](./Day6-FizzBuzz.java)
- **Description**: Print numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of three print "Fizz," for multiples of five print "Buzz," and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz."

### Day 7: [Spiral Matrix](./Day7-SpiralMatrix.java)
- **Description**: Return all elements of a matrix in spiral order.

### Day 8: [Palindrome Number](./Day8-PalindromeNumber.java)
- **Description**: Determine if a given number is a palindrome.
