# Daily DSA Challenges

Welcome to my repository dedicated to daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges! This project is designed to help me practice and improve my coding skills by solving one problem each day.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- To strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts.
- To document my solutions and thought processes.
- To build a portfolio of coding challenges.

## ðŸ“š Languages and Technologies

- **Java**: Main programming language for challenges.

## ðŸ¥‡ Challenge Log

### Day 1: [Third Maximum Number](Day1-ThirdMax.java)
- **Description**: Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.
  
### Day 2: [Search Insert Position](./Day2-SearchInsert.java)
- **Description**: Search for a target value in a sorted array or determine the position where it should be inserted.

### Day 3: [Remove Element](./Day3-RemoveElement.java)
- **Description**: Remove all instances of a specific value from an array.

### Day 4: [Max Consecutive Ones](./Day4-MaxConsecutiveOnes.java)
- **Description**: Find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array.

### Day 5: [Length of Last Word](./Day5-LengthOfLastWord.java)
- **Description**: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

### Day 6: [FizzBuzz](./Day6-FizzBuzz.java)
- **Description**: Print numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of three print "Fizz," for multiples of five print "Buzz," and for multiples of both print "FizzBuzz."

### Day 7: [Spiral Matrix](./Day7-SpiralMatrix.java)
- **Description**: Return all elements of a matrix in spiral order.

### Day 8: [Palindrome Number](./Day8-PalindromeNumber.java)
- **Description**: Determine if a given number is a palindrome.

### Day 9: [Two Sum](Day9_twosum.java)
- **Description**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### Day 10: [Trapping Water](Day10_TrappingWater.java)
- **Description**: We need to calculate how much rainwater can be trapped between buildings after it rains. The buildings are represented by an array of heights, and the amount of water trapped depends on how tall the surrounding buildings are.

### Day 11: [Maximum Sub Array](Day11_MaxSubArray.java)
- **Description**: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

### Day 12: [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](Day12_SearchInArray.java)
- **Description**: Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

### Day 13: [Container With Most Water](Day13_ContainerWithMostWater.java)
- **Description**: Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

### Day 14: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](Day14_BuySell.java)
- **Description**: You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

### Day 15: [ Longest Palindromic Substring](Day15_LongestPalindrome.java)
- **Description**:Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

### Day 16: [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](Day16_findMinimum.java)
- **Description**: Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

### Day 17: [longestCommonPrefix](Day17_longestCommonPrefix.java)
- **Description**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Day 18: [Valid Anagram](Day18_ValidAnagram.java)
- **Description**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Day 19: [Valid Parentheses](Day19_ValidParentheses.java)
- **Description**: Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Day 20: [Set Matrix Zeroes](Day20_SetMatrixZeroes.java)
- **Description**: Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

### Day 21: [Maximum Swap](Day21_MaximumSwap.java)
- **Description**: You are given an integer num. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number.
Return the maximum valued number you can get.

### Day 22: [Is Subsequence](Day22_IsSubsequence.java)
- **Description**: Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise..

### Day 23: [Word Search](Day23_WordSearch.java)
- **Description**: Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
